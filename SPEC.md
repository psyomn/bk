# Specification

Markdown--

A markdown specification that is a subset of mardkwon.

Much more simple, much more parser friendly, taylored for developers.

It shall have:
- Headers (only support n-hashes \#+)
- bullet points (only hyphens)
- code blocks (backticks for the fences)
- programming language support of code blocks (basically the parser
  should support an id after the first fence)
